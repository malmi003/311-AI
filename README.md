### Project Information 
Homelessness is a huge problem in the Twin-Cities area. 311-AI aims to help solve that problem by offloading some of the issues people experiencing homelessness have to an AI chatbot. This way people experiencing homeless can ask simple questions to a chatbot that has up-to-date information and social workers can focus more time on helping people with more complicated requests.
